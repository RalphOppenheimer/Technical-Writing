# Introduction
This document is a flexible and evolving reference used for approaching description and translation of projects to the final user.

# Essentials
In my opinion, user manual or documetation should start with a good overview of what actually is being described. Depending on complexity, it is worth to guide the user through basic procedure of:
1. Describing (naming) the elements of the machine - based on a photograph or reference drawing
2. How to power the device on - guide user by using the already described elements and how to interact with them.
3. How to make the device "do something" - the simplest, or the most frequent used functionality.
4. Safety measures: 
	4.1. what should not be done,
	4.2. what needs periodic maintenance, 
	4.3. what to do in case of hazardous behaviour 
5. As a last resort and quick reference - including FAQ in case of long manuals can be added.
