# Introduction
This document is a flexible and evolving reference used for approaching description and translation of projects to the final user.

# Essentials
In my opinion, user manual or documetation should start with a good overview of what actually is being described. Depending on complexity, it is worth to guide the user through basic procedure of:

## 1. Audience definition
1.1. **Operators**: Daily users, need clear procedures
1.2. **Maintenance**: Technicians, need technical details  
1.3. **Engineers**: Developers, need system architecture
## 2. Describing elements 
2.1. Use drawings or photographs showing elements and describing them.
## 3. How to power the device on 
3.1. Guide user by using the already described elements and how to interact with them.
3.2. Add a troubleshooting if the device may not power on after the steps listed earlier.
## 4. How to make the device "do something"
4.1 The simplest functionality 
4.2 The most frequently used functionality.
## 5. Safety: 
5.1. what should not be done,
5.2. what needs periodic maintenance, 
5.3. what to do in case of hazardous behaviour 
## 6. FAQ
6.1. As a last resort and quick reference - including FAQ in case of long manuals can be added.
